# Economic Indicator Analysis

## What is it about?

Our project attempts to investigate economic indicators responsible for the economic growth of India, we wish
to learn how the economic indicators are correlated with each
other. We have accumulated data from 1960-2020 to do a timeseries analysis. We will take a deep dive into the trends witnessed
over the years and how they affected other economic indicators.
We will also study what economic indicators are highly correlated
with GDP as GDP is commonly accepted as the primary source
of judging economic growth.

## Our Dataset

We choose data collected by the World Bank in the form of the the [World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators).
They allowed us to tailor a custom dataset through the vast number of indicators they have collected data for. Our dataset only took indicator data for India, as our study pertains to that.

## Our approach to the problem

Our team started off by understanding all the indicators and their relavence by performing Exploratory Data Analysis in the form of `EDA.ipynb`
